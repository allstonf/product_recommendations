# Location Weather API and Product Recommendations

## Location Weather API Documentation:
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/allston.fojas/DMA_Weather_API/1.0.0

## Steps for the Location Weather API:

1. Get recent NOAA Climate Data from the NOAA website to be able to automatically update the weather data twice a day
2. Merge the NOAA Station Observation Data with the NOAA Station Lat/Long Data
3. Read in DMA Data and Change Data Layout to a List of Dictionaries

4.1. Filter NOAA stations to get just US Locations and Find the Closest DMA for each Station

4.2. Calculate Haversine Distance to Find the Closest DMA for each Station

4.3. Convert the NOAA & DMA data from a Dictionary to a DataFrame

5. Get the Data of whether it is rainy/snowy for a particular DMA
6. Access API to Get the Data of whether it is rainy/snowy for a particular DMA

## Steps for the Product Recommendations:

1. Web scrape Amazon for products used in rainy or snowy weather
2. Perform Feature Engineering
- Remove all the NaN values
- Combine all the fields into a large string and put into new column called features
- Remove the stop words, or articles
- Compute count matrix
- Compute cosine similarity
3. Make product links as hyperlinks
4. Get product recommendations

## GHCN Daily By Year Documentation
___https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/___

___gchn-daily-by_year-format.rtf___

The following information serves as a definition of each field in one line of data covering one station-day. Each field described below is separated by a comma ( , ) and follows the order
presented in this document.

- ID = 11 character station identification code
- YEAR/MONTH/DAY = 8 character date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g. 19860529 = May 29, 1986)
- ELEMENT = 4 character indicator of element type 
- DATA VALUE = 5 character data value for ELEMENT 
- M-FLAG = 1 character Measurement Flag 
- Q-FLAG = 1 character Quality Flag 
- S-FLAG = 1 character Source Flag 
- OBS-TIME = 4-character time of observation in hour-minute format (i.e. 0700 =7:00 am)

See section III of the GHCN-Daily readme.txt file for an explanation of ELEMENT codes and their units as well as the M-FLAG, Q-FLAGS and S-FLAGS.

The OBS-TIME field is populated with the observation times contained in NOAA/NCDCâ€™s Multinetwork Metadata System (MMS).

___Station ID:___

ID         is the station identification code.  Please see "ghcnd-stations.txt"
           for a complete list of stations and their metadata.
           
___Date:___
Year and Month

___Observation Type:___
ELEMENT    is the element type.   There are five core elements as well as a number
           of addition elements.  
	   
           The five core elements are:

           PRCP = Precipitation (tenths of mm)
           SNOW = Snowfall (mm)
           SNWD = Snow depth (mm)
           TMAX = Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
           TMIN = Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
           
           The other elements are located in the README linked above.

___Measurement Flag:___
